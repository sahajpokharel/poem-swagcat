Love is a journey, a path to explore,
A feeling that's worth fighting for,
It's the warmth of a hug, the joy of a kiss,
A connection that's hard to miss.

In the realm of code, where worlds take flight,
A kingdom of developers, day and night.
GitHub, the haven, where projects reside,
A sanctuary of collaboration worldwide.
